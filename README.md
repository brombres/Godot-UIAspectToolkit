# Godot-UIAspectToolkit
A collection of Godot UI controls that primarily assist with user interfaces that need to dynamically scale while preserving aspect ratio.

# Project Abandoned

These controls work "pretty well" but they feel kludgey and brittle. I'm starting work on a [new library](https://github.com/brombres/Godot-GameGUI) that will piggyback on existing Control nodes and provide a comprehensive dynamic layout solution.
